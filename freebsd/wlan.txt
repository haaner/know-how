Introduction

Setting up wireless networking on FreeBSD is not as complex as in the past. Here’s the short form. The examples that follow show a RealTek wireless device using the urtw(4) driver.
Setup For Automatic Wireless Connection

If needed, load driver modules in /boot/loader.conf.

if_urtw_load="YES"

Create /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf with SSID and PSK.

network={
        ssid="myssid"
        psk="myultrasecretkey"
}

Modify /etc/rc.conf to create wlan0 and connect:

wlans_urtw0="wlan0"
ifconfig_wlan0="WPA SYNCDHCP"

On startup, FreeBSD will automatically connect.

That’s it, pretty much all you need. Stop here unless you want to manually start a wireless connection.
Command Line Manual Method

(1) # kldload if_urtw  1
(2) # ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev urtw0  2
(3) # wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf  3
(4) # dhclient wlan0  4

(1)	If your wireless card driver isn’t built into the GENERIC kernel, or you use a custom kernel without it, the driver module must be loaded first. Some devices also need firmware modules, usually provided by a port. See the man page for your device.
(2)	Create a generic wireless device for the wireless network code to use.
(3)	Run wpa_supplicant(8) to associate to an access point defined in /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf.
(4) Get an IP address and DNS servers.
